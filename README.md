# Designs
note that this is the initial UI, it could be slightly different when i implement it.

Discription for each page:

home page: maybe i could welcome the user and tell him about the website and how he could use it.

Recipes: it will show cards that includes recipes that the user created and the description of each recipe with the recipe's image. 

Add Recipe: asks the user to create new recipe with the directions of what exactly he should write.

Login: a simple typical login page.

signup: pretty like the login page with the change of the title.

NOTE: the designs are made by PaintðŸ˜‰
